    "- **Physical Planning** phase is where the logical plan is translated into one or more physical plans, which can actually be executed on the cluster. This includes operations like file `scans`, `filters`, `projections`, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this case, during the logical planning phase, the predicate (`F.col(\"city\") == \"boston\"`) has been pushed down and will be applied during the scan of the Parquet file (`PushedFilters: [IsNotNull(city), EqualTo(city,boston)]`), thus improving performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, during the physical planning phase, the same filter condition (`+- *(1) Filter (isnotnull(city#73) AND (city#73 = boston))`) is applied again to the data that's been loaded into memory. This is because of the following reasons:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Guaranteed Correctness:** It might seem **redundant**, but remember that not all data sources can handle pushed-down predicates, and not all predicates can be pushed down. Therefore, **even if a predicate is pushed down to the data source, Spark still includes the predicate in the physical plan** to cover cases where the data source might not have been able to fully apply the predicate. This is Spark's way of making sure the correct data is always returned, no matter the capabilities of the data source.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **No Assumptions**: Spark's Catalyst optimizer doesn't make assumptions about the data source's ability to handle pushed-down predicates. The optimizer aims to generate plans that return correct results across a wide range of scenarios. Even if the filter is pushed down, Spark does not have the feedback from data source whether the pushdown was successful or not, so it includes the filter operation in the physical plan as well.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is more of a **fail-safe mechanism** to ensure data **integrity** and **correctness**.\n",

    "In Spark, `Parquet` data source does not support pushdown for filters involving a `.cast` operation. The reason for this behaviour is as follows:\n",
    "- `.cast` changes the datatype of the column, and the Parquet data source may not be able to perform the filter operation correctly on the cast data.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note**: This behavior may vary based on the data source. For example, if you're working with a JDBC data source connected to a database that supports SQL-like operations, the `.cast` filter could potentially be pushed down to the database."
